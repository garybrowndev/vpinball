dumpbin /EXPORTS bass.dll >bass64.def
(note that this may not fully work for decorated functions, e.g. if stdcall is used, the @XX suffix may be missing)

add EXPORTS at beginning of file, only leave function names in after that
(in the above special case, the suffix may need to be extracted otherwise, and each line has to feature a "functionname@XX=functionname")
(in addition it may also be needed to add the ordinal from the dumpbin like "functionname@XX=functionname @N")
